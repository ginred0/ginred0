This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

About me
======
Welcome to my homepage!

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), supervised by Prof. Xuetao Wei since 2021. My research focuses on the societal impact of AI, particularly on promoting fairness for human participants in distributed model training and human-AI collaboration.

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant (2020â€“2021) under the supervision of Prof. James J.Q. Yu at SUSTech. Before joining SUSTech, I was a data engineer at the Von Neumann Data Studio, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd, from 2019 to 2020.

I earned my M.E. degree in the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2019 and my B.E. degree in Measurement and Control Technology and Instrumentation from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).

Research interest
======
**Fairness in Machine Learning**
- Algorithmic Fairness
- Game Theory for AI's Societal Challenge
- Societal Challenge in Human-AI Collaboration

As large language models (LLMs) provide richer interactions with humans and access to more diverse information sources, they enable decision-making support that is increasingly expert-like and widely applicable. My research also focuses on exploring human-LLM interaction mechanisms to better meet broader societal requirements.
